    <h1>Latest News</h1>
    <p>As of February 2026, Meta is developing two new VR headsets: a lightweight, glasses-like device expected in early 2027 (potentially codenamed Puffin) and a high-end Meta Quest 4 focusing on gaming. While Meta is shifting focus toward AR and cutting 10% of Reality Labs staff, the market sees continued success in social VR and new 2026, 4.9-star rated titles.</p>
    <p>Steam Frame is still shipping sometime in the first half of 2026, although now Valve says the current component shortage has led the company to revise both price and release date of the standalone VR headset.</p>
    <p>Valve announced in a hardware news update that Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and Steam Controller are all being affected by the component shortage.</p>
    <p>“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now,” Valve says. “But the memory and storage shortages you’ve likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then.”</p>
